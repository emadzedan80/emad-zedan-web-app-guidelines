## 2. Documentation

- Use this [template](./README.sample.md) for `README.md`, Feel free to add uncovered sections.
- For projects with more than one repository, provide links to them in their respective `README.md` files.
- Keep `README.md` updated as a project evolves.
- Comment your code. Try to make it as clear as possible what you are intending with each major section.
- If there is an open discussion on github or stackoverflow about the code or approach you're using, include the link in your comment.
- Don't use comments as an excuse for a bad code. Keep your code clean.
- Don't use clean code as an excuse to not comment at all.
- Keep comments relevant as your code evolves.
